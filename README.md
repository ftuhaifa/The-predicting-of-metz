**Pickle**

To use the rakel_model.pkl file in a different script or file, you need to load the model (both ensemble and labelsets) from the pickle file and use it to make predictions. Below are the steps to achieve this.

**Steps to Use rakel_model.pkl in a Different File:**
Load the model from the pickle file.
Use the loaded model to make predictions.

**Example of Using rakel_model.pkl in a Different File:**

Let's assume you have saved your rakel_model.pkl from the training script. Now, you want to create a new script (e.g., predict_with_rakel.py) to load the model and use it for predictions.

**1. Import Necessary Libraries and Load the Pickle File**

import pickle
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import os

**Key Points:**

Load the Model: The load_model function reads the rakel_model.pkl file and retrieves the saved ensemble of classifiers and labelsets.

Prepare the Input Data: The input data (X_new) is prepared using the same features as those used for training the model (e.g., Age, Sex, Behavior, etc.).

Use the Model for Prediction: The predict_rakel function is used to predict the labels for the new dataset using the loaded model.

NewLungCancerData.csv: Replace 'NewLungCancerData.csv' with the actual file or data you want to use for making predictions.

**Example Workflow:**

Train and Save the Model: In your training script, you saved the model to rakel_model.pkl.

Use in New Script: In a new script, load the saved model from rakel_model.pkl and use it to make predictions on new data.

**How to Run:**

Save the code in a new Python file (e.g., predict_with_rakel.py).

Make sure the rakel_model.pkl file and the new dataset (NewLungCancerData.csv) are in the same directory as the script.

Run the script to load the model and make predictions.
